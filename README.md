Web application project for Electrical engineering using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and Bootstrap 5.
Created registration and login system and added roles for users.
To create an admin role you need to change the role directly in the database when you first register your profile.
All tables are created directly in Spring Boot in the folder "model". 
To run this application you need to have installed Java 17 and MySQL server, to make it easier use MySQL Workbench to create a database "elektro" when you first run the app. 
All settings of application you can check in the file "pom.xml" and "resources/application.properties"
